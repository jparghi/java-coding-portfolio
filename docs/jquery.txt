Upgrading jQuery from 1.10.4/2.1.4 to 3.7.1 caused significant UI breakages due to incompatibilities with Dojo, Accordion library, WET4, and custom JavaScript components. Several legacy functions and event handlers no longer work as expected, requiring extensive refactoring and testing. Given the high impact on stability and effort required for fixes, we recommend postponing the upgrade or exploring a phased migration strategy with compatibility patches.
